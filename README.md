# Linux Kernel Packaging Helpers

Build distro-specific kernel packages from a checked out (potentially dirty) git kernel tree.

Provides `kpgk.py` scripts for creating clean Arch Linux and Debian kernel packages using a previously checked out git source tree.
Run the scripts directly from the checked out tree.
Use the provided containerfiles with [toolbox](https://github.com/containers/toolbox) to compile for different distributions.

Refer to the respective scripts for more information.
